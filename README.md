# LowLevelCode

In this repo you will find some files and projects focusing on my personal development of low level code and computer fundamentals understanding. 
Inside each of the folders on this repo you will find another README.md file describing what that folder holds and its purpose, so please read them if you don't know what is inside of them. 
Hope this helps you! :D
